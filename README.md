# Cryptocurrencies

## AI - Unsupervised Machine Learning

A comprehensive analysis of several cryptocurrencies, with the objective of finding some clusters of data using unsupervised machine leraning for the purpose of giving advice on how to better invest on Cryptocurrencies.

## Steps
1. Start Code was provided
2. Data was cleaned and processed
3. Data reduction was made with PCA
4. Data was clusterd using K-means
5. Visualizations were created to format and present results

## Code
Python via JupyterNotebooks - data scrubbing

## Visualization
* 3D-Scatter - PCA and clusters data

## Conclusion: 
* Type 1 coins offer the highest supply available with the least amount mined ratio of all 4 classes compared using models above.  Popular examples of this class which are recommended for investment are Bitcoin, Etherium and Litcoin.
